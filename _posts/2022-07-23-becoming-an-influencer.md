Would you like your messages to be heard by a big audience?
Earn money by talking about the things that you love to do?
Have a positive impact on others?
Being an influencer or content creator seems like a desirable way to earn an income.

Let me start by telling you that I'm not big on social media.
I have a poorly maintained Instagram profile, check facebook once a week for birthdays, and do not understand
the hype around TikTok.
I do not comprehend how people capture their entire live and never put their phone down.
Nevertheless, I appreciate content that engages, informs, or sometimes distracts from the task at hand.

Also, cooking became a hobby of mine recently.
Transforming basic ingredients into something delicious seems like a marvelous way to spend ones time.
I am by no means an expert, but by now I get some basics, like fresh bread and pasta dough, right.
To step up those skills and broaden my repertoire is the next goal.

One evening I thought - why not combine the two interests?
Stick my toes into the water and discover how it is like to maintain an active and engaging Instagram profile.
Cooking would become the main theme around [@eggcellent_homecook](https://www.instagram.com/eggcellent_homecook/).

In addition to regular posts about breakfast, lunch, and dinner on that Instagram channel, I will write supplemental
blog posts to dive into the lessons learned.
Those might include new techniques in the kitchen, but I will mainly focus on surroundings.
Improving my pictures, capturing videos, and finding the right hashtag are things that I will need to work on.
And aside from the content there might be other challenges in the process of building a large audience.
Maybe we will even dive into how to find partners and promotions.

Stay tuned for more information on becoming an influencer.
And leave a like in case you are interested in being part of the journey.
