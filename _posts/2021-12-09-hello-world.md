Hello World,

This is my first post in a hopefully long series of blog entries about a diverse range of topics.
I have to admit that this is not the first time that I try to start a blog.
Previous attempts were discontinued due to a lack of time or my impression that I got nothing
of interest to say.
I hope that I can convince you and myself that this is not the case.

The spark for this attempt was another blog post about cryptocurrencies in which the author
argued that one should agree with someone who is known to be reasonable and better informed about a topic.
On the topic of cryptocurrencies I know a lot of people that know more than I do, but there is no consensus
among them if those are a giant Ponzi scheme or an actual glimpse into the future.
Therefore, the first series of posts will focus on crypto.
My plan is to start with the basics.
What is a cryptocurrency?
How are they generated and transferred?
Should we even call them a currency?
Afterwards we will go down the rabbit hole to look at NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) and the promises of DeFi (Decentralized
Finance).

Apart from my desire to expand my knowledge I'm an avid reader and will share insights into books that I find interesting.
I also spend a lot of time thinking about personal finance topics like saving, investing, and meme-stock gambling.
Hence, expect those to show up from time to time.

To close this initial post I have a small request to anyone reading my posts - if you spot a mistake of any kind, please
notify me, and I will make sure to correct it swiftly.
At some point I will likely introduce a kind of bug bounty programme, but this is a topic for another day.

Cheers,
Steffen
