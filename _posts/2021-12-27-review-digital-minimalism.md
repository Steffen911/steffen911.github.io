If you're not paying for a service, you're the product.
Your time = their money.
I guess most of us heard those or similar sentences about Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, etc.
In Cal Newport's ["Digital Minimalism"](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Cal-Newport/dp/0241453577/ref=sr_1_1){:target="_blank"} they are a central
theme as well.
I recently finished this book and will use this post to collect my thoughts and ideas around the topics that were discussed.
Overall, the book is enjoyable and includes some food for thought, but certain proposals and examples seem a bit far-fetched.
Discussions about Lincoln's life and the American civil war came as a surprise, and, in my opinion, do not support
any case against or in favour of consuming social media.
Nevertheless, I identified three major ideas in the book that I would like to summarize and share here.

## Be intentional about your consumption

I have a Facebook, LinkedIn, and Instagram account.
Additionally, I spend time on Hacker News, Netflix, and sometimes Reddit.
An educated guess, based on the Screen Time application on my phone, puts my daily use of those services to about
60 minutes.
Most people will have a similar list, given that the average time spent on Facebook's services is 50 minutes a day.

The first part of digital minimalism encourages you to take a look at the services that you use and the value they
provide.
Is the benefit that a service provides larger than the potential cost of keeping it?
To make an educated decision one could try a 30-day abstinence of all services.
Otherwise, one probably overestimates the impact of losing the service.
I might continue to use Instagram to get recent updates of where my friends are and what they are up to.

In a second step, I should consider if there is a better way to do this.
Is Facebook or WhatsApp better to keep track?
May I use LinkedIn instead or try to get regular updates my frequent inquiries?

I came to the conclusion that I want to keep using Instagram for this.
The final step for digital minimalism is being intentional about the usage.
Stories are around for 24 hours after their creation.
Also, I do not need to follow any brands or famous influences to achieve what Instagram is supposed to do for me.
In the end I unfollowed everyone, but close friends and contacts, and removed the Instagram application from my
phone.
I can check statuses and posts daily in the web-browser, but do not start to mindlessly scroll content in the explore
section.

Overall, this boils down to decluttering, optimizing, and planning.

## Conversations over connections

Now, one could object that this reduces interactions with friends and family.
I might not like their pictures immediately, comment less frequently, or miss out on entire updates, because
they prefer to use a service that I deactivated.
Newport draws on Sherry Turkle's ["Reclaiming Conversation"](https://www.amazon.com/Reclaiming-Conversation-Power-Talk-Digital/dp/0143109790){:target="_blank"}
for an interesting point of view.
A "conversation" is a meaningful, high-quality interaction.
This might be a real-life conversation, a phone call, or some video chat.
A "connection" on the other hand is a digital interactions.
It covers texts, comments, and likes.
Conversations are far more valuable to maintain relationships than connections.
We just feel connected by frequent digital connections like texts.
The author makes a point in proposing that we reduce connections to a facilitator or conversation instead of seeing
them as an end in themselves.
Here, I fully agree with the proposal.
It might be a bit less convenient in the short term to call someone instead of sending a text, but the positive impact
of a conversation is much greater.

## Active recovery

I'm not an avid runner and, therefore, the following sentence is only an assumption.
Sometimes I have a feeling that I'm more exhausted after a Netflix marathon than I would be after the real thing.
After a long work week I'm inclined to spend the weekend in front of the TV to relax.
While reading the "Reclaim Leisure" chapter I noticed that this is one of the worst things I can do.
Constant input with little need for processing keeps the brain busy enough to not recover, but does not challenge
it in a stimulating way.
Social interactions are also minimal.
Instead, I often feel more refreshed and active on Monday morning if I spend my weekend on the golf course,
a city trip, or the tennis court.
The author makes a case for active, physical, and social leisure activities, and I wholeheartedly agree after
reflecting on my past experience.

## Conclusion

I'm confident that my post summarized the essence of the book.
Sections on solitude, methods of social networks to lure you in, and the "attention resistance" movement were
skipped though.
I was under the impression that those added some fluff around the main contents, but lacked sufficient depth to be
considered an independent, valuable contribution.
Newport's writing style seems too verbose at times, but the topic and the contents are fascinating.
His previous book, ["Deep Work"](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Cal-Newport/dp/0349411905/ref=sr_1_1){:target="_blank"}, and one of the
references in the book, ["Lead Yourself First"](https://www.amazon.com/Lead-Yourself-First-Inspiring-Leadership/dp/1632866315){:target="_blank"}
by Kethledge and Erwin, got prime spots on my reading list.
Overall, I would recommend the book.
Even if I does not apply all suggestions I'm confident that it helps to make deliberate decisions about how I spend
my time and what I consume.
